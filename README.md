# QuadTargetFSM
C++ and OpenCV implementation of quadcopter target tracking algorithm.
This is my cleaned up version that uses a finite state machine to detect the
marker patterns. Working slightly better (AKA can actually track targerts)
and more efficiently and less buggily than the original implementation.
